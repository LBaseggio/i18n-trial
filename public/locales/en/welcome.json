    "paragraphOne": "I've been coding for almost 2yrs and I still kept asking myself the same question: Why do I code?. I was 16/yo when I started to write codes using HTML and CSS only. I have this mentor, adviser, and teacher in our school. His name is Cris. And while I was downloading some pirated tutorials from udemy in our computer lab. Cris suddenly approaches me and ask me if I want to join a Web Design contest in our school. My response to Him (with a pessimist mind) was 'I'm sorry but I cannot, because I know nothing about writing codes'."
